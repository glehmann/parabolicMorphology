\begin{abstract}
\noindent
Morphological erosion and dilation filters employ a structuring
function, with flat structuring functions being the most common
example. Parabolic\footnote{This article will use the term
``parabolic'', but much of the literature uses ``quadratic''}
structuring functions are less well known but theoretically very
important and practically very useful. This paper briefly introduces
morphology using parabolic structuring functions, describes the ITK
classes used to implement them and includes a number of sample
applications.

\section{Introduction}
Parabolic structuring functions (PSF) have the following important properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item They are closed under dilation - i.e. dilating two PSFs in a third PSF.
\item An n-dimensional PSF can be obtained by combining n
one-dimensional PSFs in independent directions.
\item PSFs are rotationally symmetric allowing the dimensional
decomposition by dilation.
\end{itemize}
These properties make PSFs the morphological counterpart of the
Gaussian in linear image processing \cite{Boomgaard96}.

The dimensional decompostion properties lead to efficient algorithms
for implementing parabolic morphological operations.

Parabolic morphology operations are useful in image sharpening,
distance transforms, are a less vigorous alternative to conventional
morphological operations based on flat structuring elements and a
potentially useful, faster, alternative to shaped structuring elements
such as the ``rolling ball'' often used in background estimation in
tools such as ImageJ.

\section{Brief background theory}
A dilation by a one dimensional parabolic structuring element is
illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:paradilate}. The dilation of the signal
at point A is found by lowering the structuring function centred at A
until the structuring function comes into contact with the signal, in
this case at point B. The dilation at this point is given by point C,
the height of the parabola turning point. The equivalent erosion is
calculated by raising an inverted parabola into the signal from below.

\end{figure}

\section{ITK classes}
The filters discussed in this section implement the ``point of
contact'' algorithm \cite{Boomgaard96}. Algorithms that are more
efficient for larger kernel sizes are available and are discussed by
van den Boomgaard et al, but haven't been implemented in this package.
The classes {\em itkParabolicErodeImageFilter}, {\em
itkParabolicDilateImageFilter}, {\em itkParabolicCloseImageFilter} and
{\em itkParabolicOpenImageFilter} provide the range of parabolic
morphology operations. These classes derive from {\em
itkParabolicErodeDilateImageFilter} and {\em
itkParabolicOpenCloseImageFilter}, which implement the core
functionality. The open and close filters offer an optional border
padding facility.

The controling methods available for these classes is :
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Set/GetScale} : a PSF is usually defined as $f(x)=\frac{1}{2\rho}x^2$. This method sets $\rho$.
\item {\bf Set/GetUseImageSpacing} : defines whether the units for $\rho$ are voxels or image spacing.
\item {\bf SetSafeBorder} : controls whether border padding is used in opening or closing operations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Applications}
\subsection{Sharpening}
Image sharpening using parabolic operations has been analysed in
\cite{Schavemaker2000}. This form of sharpening is based on the following formula:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon[f](x, \rho) =
\begin{cases}
F^\oplus(x,\rho), &F^\oplus(x,\rho) - F(x,0) < F(x,0) - F^\ominus(x,\rho),\\
F^\ominus(x,\rho), &F^\oplus(x,\rho) - F(x,0) > F(x,0) - F^\ominus(x,\rho),\\
F(x,0), &otherwise
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $F^\oplus(x,\rho)$ indicates dilation by parabolic structuring
element with scale $\rho$ amd $F^\ominus$ indicates erosion. In
summary, the output of the sharpening process at a pixel is the
dilation, if the difference between the dilation and the input is less
than the difference between the erosion and the input. This formula
describes one step in an iterative process. The parameters controling
the process are scale and number of iterations.

This sharpening algorithm has been implemented in the {\em
  itkMorphologicalSharpeningImageFilter}, and {\em testSharpening}
illustrates its use. Figure \ref{fig:sharpprofs} illustrates the
results of sharpening using profiles through an artificial image.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{sharp.eps}
\caption{Profiles through an artificial image illustrating the sharpening process. Scale value was 1 pixel.\label{fig:sharpprofs}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Distance Tranforms}
Parabolic erosions and dilations can be used to construct distance
transforms. Two classes have been provided in this package:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em itkMorphologicalDistanceTransformImageFilter} for one sided distance transforms.
\item {\em itkMorphologicalSignedDistanceTransformImageFilter} for signed distance transforms.
\end{itemize}
The concept is fairly simple - consider applying a parabolic erosion,
with scale 1, to a mask image with values of $0$ and $\inf$. The value
of the erosion at mask locations with value 0 will remain 0. The value
at mask locations of $\inf$ are equal to the square of the distance to
the nearest 0 value. The idea can be easily extended to allow
computation of the inside and outside distances without
rethresholding. This method should be more accurate than basic chamfer
approaches and appears slightly faster than the {\em
  SignedDanielssonDistanceTransform} currently provided in ITK, as
illustrated in Table \ref{tbl:perf}. The parabolic version does not
return voronoi tesselations or vectors pointing to the nearest inverse
pixel because such things aren't required in construction of the
distance transform. I cannot comment on the relative accuracy of the
two methods at this stage as there appears to be no difference in
output for the cthead image, but expect that the Danielsson method
uses approximations that aren't necessary in the parabolic
version. There are prospect for further improvement when the parabolic
methods are threaded. The parabolic method should retain efficiency in
arbitary dimensions due to the separable nature of the parabolic
operations.

\section{Conclusions and further work}
This article introduces implementations of an important class of
morphological operations - erosions and dilations be parabolic
structuring elements. Applications of these operations to sharpening
and distance transforms are also presented. The latter appears to
outperform some existing implementations, but more tests are
necessary.
